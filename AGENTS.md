Cloudflare control plane, builder agent, user-owned workspace runtime, and generated-application template.

## Code index

- `user-workspace-runtime/src/index.ts` and `user-workspace-runtime/src/protocol.ts` — project storage, previews, validation, deployment, and browser protocol
- `template/` — generated application source and security migrations
- `make-bootstrap-snapshot.js` and `scripts/verify-template.mjs` — template artifact generation and verification

- `migrations/` and `wrangler.jsonc` — control-plane schema and bindings

## Invariants

- Product code is self-contained in this repository; do not depend on sibling repositories.
- User workloads, backing resources, and inference run only in the authenticated user's Cloudflare account. Missing user resources fail closed.
- Do not hand-edit generated route trees, Worker binding types, or generated bundle modules. After changing `template/` or the workspace runtime, run `pnpm run generate:artifacts`.

## Commands

```sh
pnpm run validate
pnpm run ops
pnpm run ops:json
```

The ops commands read production state through the operator's Wrangler authentication and must remain read-only.
