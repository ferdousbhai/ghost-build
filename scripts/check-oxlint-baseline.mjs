/**
 * Ratchet every Oxlint finding against a recorded baseline.
 *
 * Oxlint reports 1,600+ anti-slop findings against this repository. Nearly all of them are one
 * architectural pattern: Durable Object RPC entry points that accept `unknown` and validate with
 * hand-rolled `record()`/`requireString()`/`typeof` guards, where the plugin wants a named domain
 * type parsed at the boundary. Converting that is a real migration, not a lint cleanup.
 *
 * The two obvious responses are both wrong. Leaving `oxlint` in the blocking lint gate makes
 * `pnpm run validate` unpassable, so nothing can be handed off — the repository's own review rule
 * becomes unsatisfiable. Downgrading or disabling the rules throws away the signal and is
 * explicitly what the install-anti-slop skill forbids.
 *
 * So every rule stays at `error` and every finding stays reported; this script only decides what
 * *fails the build*. A finding already present when the baseline was taken is debt, counted and
 * visible. A finding beyond it is a regression and fails.
 *
 * The count can only go down, and `--update` is what enforces that rather than what undermines it:
 * it refuses to record any (file, rule) count above the one already there. Accepting new debt is
 * possible but has to be asked for by name, so it is a decision in a diff rather than a reflex
 * when the build goes red.
