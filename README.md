# Ghostbuild

Ghostbuild is an AI builder for applications on the Cloudflare developer platform. Its Durable Object workspace and
isolated Cloudflare build runtime work from desktop and mobile browsers, generate Cloudflare-native projects, and
deploy them to the user's own Cloudflare account.

Try it at [ghostbuild.dev](https://ghostbuild.dev).

## Requirements

- Node.js 26 or newer
- pnpm 11.14.0, as pinned by `packageManager`
- A Cloudflare account for production deployment

## Setup

```bash
nvm use
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run validate
```

Production provisioning and the Cloudflare Workers Builds deployment path are documented in
[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).
