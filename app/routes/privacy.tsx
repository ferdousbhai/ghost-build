      <TrustSection title="Data, purposes, and legal bases">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Account and authentication:</strong> Cloudflare identity, name, email, avatar, session records,
            OAuth state, and connection status. These are used to authenticate you and provide the service you request,
            including steps taken before and during the service agreement. The identity and authorization fields are
            required to use signed-in features; without them, Ghostbuild cannot provide those features.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cloudflare connection:</strong> account identifiers, granted scopes, runtime locators, and encrypted
            credentials. These are used to operate the Cloudflare integration you authorize. Tokens, ciphertext, IVs,
            credential handles, and capability secrets are excluded from account-data responses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Projects and conversations:</strong> chat metadata, transcripts, generated files, revisions,
            validation receipts, deployment plans, approvals, and deployment status. These are processed and stored in
            the connected Cloudflare account to generate, recover, validate, and deploy your project under the service
            agreement. The operator’s control-plane database does not store prompt or transcript bodies, project source,
            or deployment plans. You choose what project content to provide, but Ghostbuild cannot perform a requested
            build without the content needed for that request.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Service and security logs:</strong> sampled Worker invocation, Container, and trace metadata can
            include request method and path, Cloudflare request metadata, response status, timing, binding activity, and
            exception or diagnostic metadata. The Ghostbuild control plane samples 60% of Worker logs and 5% of traces.
            In your connected Cloudflare account, the workspace runtime samples 60% of Worker logs and enables Computer
            container logs; generated applications sample 60% of Worker logs and 5% of traces. These settings support
            operation, troubleshooting, and security under the operator’s legitimate interests. Prompts, source code,
            credentials, and raw tool output are not intended log fields.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Support, privacy, and legal records:</strong> contact details, message contents, attachments, case
            metadata, and reports you submit. These are used for the operator’s legitimate interests in answering
            requests, protecting users and infrastructure, enforcing the Terms, and establishing or defending legal
            claims, or to meet a legal obligation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Optional product telemetry:</strong> allowlisted events, opaque journey or error-event identifiers,
            status values, and bounded numeric metrics. Consent is requested before Ghostbuild sends this telemetry.
            Prompts, source code, credentials, URLs, and direct user identifiers are excluded. The request omits browser
            credentials; a client IP supplied by Cloudflare is used transiently as a rate-limit key and is not included
            in the application event log.

      <TrustSection title="AI processing">
        <p>
          The user-owned workspace runtime sends the prompt, conversation context, and project files needed for a
          request to the configured builder model through Cloudflare AI in the connected account. The in-chat model
          selector distinguishes Cloudflare-hosted models from partner models. If you select DeepSeek V4 Pro, Cloudflare
          lists it as a{' '}
          <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai/models/deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro/">
            third-party model served by Fireworks
          </a>
          , so Fireworks also processes the request content needed for inference. Ghostbuild does not place prompt or
          source payloads in optional product telemetry. For partner-model calls, Ghostbuild uses Cloudflare’s
          per-request controls to skip AI Gateway caching and log collection. This prevents Ghostbuild’s request from
          creating an AI Gateway log containing its prompt, response, or request metadata, regardless of the connected
          account’s gateway default. It does not change the transient processing needed for inference or provider
          billing. Cloudflare describes its handling of Workers AI content in its{' '}
          <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/platform/data-usage/">Workers AI data-usage notice</a>.
          Ghostbuild does not use AI to make decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects about you.

      <TrustSection title="Browser storage and telemetry choice">
        <p>
          Essential browser storage includes a 30-day authentication cookie, short-lived OAuth and recovery state, theme
          and builder-model preferences, and a pending prompt in tab-scoped session storage. Chat, transcript, and
          workspace presentation caches remain only in memory and are rebuilt from your Cloudflare account after a
          reload. Preferences remain until replaced or cleared in your browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          Optional product telemetry is off until you allow it. Your choice is stored locally. Ghostbuild also honors
          Global Privacy Control and Do Not Track. Disabling telemetry stops future telemetry but does not remove events
          already received. You may withdraw telemetry consent at any time without affecting processing that occurred
          before withdrawal.

        <p>
          The operator’s Cloudflare D1 stores account, authentication, encrypted Cloudflare-connection, and runtime
          locator records. It does not store prompts, chat transcripts, project source, deployment plans, or generated
          application data. Workspace metadata, Agent transcripts, project files, Computer state, previews, and
          generated infrastructure remain in the connected Cloudflare account. Your browser may keep account-local
          transcript and project-file replicas. Data is disclosed only as needed to operate the service, follow your
          instructions, protect the service, or comply with law.

        <p>
          Cloudflare provides authentication integration, Workers, D1, R2, Durable Objects, Containers, Computer,
          Workers AI, the Cloudflare AI model catalog, observability, and related infrastructure. A model provider
          listed in the selector also processes the request when you choose its partner-hosted model. GitHub processes
          information submitted through public support issues or private security reports. Control-plane observability
          is held in the operator’s Cloudflare account; workspace, Computer, and generated-application observability is
          held in your connected Cloudflare account. Ghostbuild does not sell personal data, share it for cross-context
          behavioral advertising, or use it for targeted advertising.

      <TrustSection title="Retention, removal, and deletion">
        <p>
          In the operator control plane, OAuth authorization state expires after 10 minutes, authentication sessions
          after 30 days, and unreferenced encrypted credential records become eligible for removal after 24 hours.
          Maintenance runs every 15 minutes in bounded batches, so backlog or retries can delay physical removal.
          Account, connection, and runtime-locator records remain while the account and service are active or until they
          are no longer needed or a verified request is fulfilled. There is no automatic inactive-account purge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Settings contains a self-service control that erases every record the operator holds for your account:
          identity and profile, authentication sessions, encrypted Cloudflare credentials, connection metadata and
          granted scopes, and your runtime locator. It also asks Cloudflare to revoke Ghostbuild’s authorization, and
          tells you when Cloudflare did not confirm that revocation so you can remove it yourself. Because erasure is
          irreversible it requires a Cloudflare sign-in completed in the last ten minutes, an exact typed confirmation,
          and an explicit acknowledgement of what is retained. Repeating it is harmless. If you have already revoked
          Ghostbuild’s authorization you can no longer sign in, so use the request path below instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Settings also contains a self-service export of those same operator-held records. It saves a JSON file,
          carrying a schema version and an export timestamp, containing your identity and profile, your Cloudflare
          connection metadata and granted scopes, the existence, storage time, and key version of your encrypted
          credential record, your runtime locator, and your authentication-session and OAuth-state records. Encrypted
          credential material, initialisation vectors, credential handles, and session token hashes are never exported.
          Because a single file discloses your whole account record, the export requires the same Cloudflare sign-in
          completed in the last ten minutes that erasure requires. Each section is bounded at 200 records and reports
          the untruncated count beside them, and a section that could not be read is named in the file, which reports
          itself incomplete rather than looking whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          That control deliberately deletes nothing inside your own Cloudflare account.{' '}
          <strong>
            Workers, D1 databases, R2 buckets, KV namespaces, Containers, Durable Objects, and Agents that Ghostbuild
            deployed are retained, keep running, keep billing to your account, and are yours to remove.
          </strong>{' '}
          Chats, transcripts, project files, and deployment records also stay there under that account’s controls, and
          the account export does not contain them: download individual project source with Download code in the project
          header, and use your Cloudflare account’s own tools for the rest. The browser holds no persistent chat,
          transcript, or project replica. Its theme, model, telemetry, cookie, and tab-session data are not reachable
          from the server and are in no export; Settings lists exactly what to clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          The operator’s current Cloudflare plan retains sampled control-plane Workers Logs and traces for seven days.
          Ghostbuild does not copy them to another log or trace store. Cloudflare may retain aggregate control-plane
          Worker metrics for up to three months; those metrics are not a user-addressable event ledger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Workspace Worker and Computer container logs, and generated-application Worker logs and traces, remain in your
          connected Cloudflare account. Their access and retention follow that account’s permissions, plan, product
          settings, and Cloudflare controls. Ghostbuild does not copy them into the operator’s log or trace store, and
          removing a project does not immediately erase provider-retained observability.

        <p>
          <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/reference/time-travel/">Cloudflare D1 Time Travel</a> keeps
          control-plane database changes recoverable for up to 30 days under the current plan. User-owned D1 recovery
          windows depend on the user’s Cloudflare plan. Ghostbuild will not intentionally restore erased records from
          recovery history. If broader disaster recovery reintroduces them, the erasure must be reapplied unless a
          lawful retention exception governs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Removing a project hides it from the active project list and makes its Agent and workspace eligible for
          teardown no earlier than 30 minutes later. Ghostbuild also schedules deletion of the project’s generated
          Worker and its Durable Objects, D1 databases, KV namespaces, and R2 buckets from your connected Cloudflare
          account. R2 objects are emptied in bounded batches before the bucket is deleted; provider failures or revoked
          authorization can delay cleanup and are retried while access remains available. It is not complete erasure:
          catalog, transcript, deployment, provider-retained observability, and browser records remain under their
          applicable retention boundaries. You can download individual project source before removal, and browser data
          remains until you clear it.

          erasure are all self-service in Settings, as described above. For everything else — correction, restriction,
