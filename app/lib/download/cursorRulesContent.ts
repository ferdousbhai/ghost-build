export const cursorRulesContent = `# Ghostbuild Cloudflare App Rules

- For a full web application, use TanStack Start and TanStack Router for routes and SSR unless the user requested a compatible alternative.
- For a Worker-only project, set package.json ghostbuild.projectType to "worker", use a Wrangler dry-run build targeting dist/worker, and remove unused framework dependencies, route-generation steps, and bindings.
- For HTTP APIs, webhooks, middleware, and other fetch-handler Worker scripts, use the direct Worker handler and do not invent routes, React UI, or SSR. Automatic production deployment does not yet support scheduled, queue, email, or Tail handlers.
- Add TanStack Query or TanStack DB only when the product needs client-side server-state caching or live collections.
- Keep pnpm run dev and pnpm run preview available for local and isolated remote preview.
- After changing production dependencies, run pnpm run licenses:generate before build or deploy so the shipped third-party notices match the lockfile.
- Keep Worker entrypoint code in src/server.ts.
- In generated TanStack routes and server functions, call getAppBindings() from @/app-bindings for application DB/R2 access.
- Do not import cloudflare:workers from generated source. AI, AppAgent, and AGENT_SECURITY_DB bindings are intentionally unavailable to generated routes.
- Automatically deployed AppAgent projects do not allow dynamic import(), require(), eval(), or Function constructors in generated source.
- Use Workers AI only through the reviewed AppAgent and prefer @cf/zai-org/glm-5.2 for coding-agent features.
- Use Cloudflare Agents and Durable Objects for durable agent state. For chat UI, prefer the template AIChatAgent with useAgentChat from @cloudflare/ai-chat/react.
- Set static override options = { sendIdentityOnConnect: false } when Agent instance names can contain chat IDs, user IDs, or session IDs, and use state updates rather than agent.identified for readiness.
- Treat client-supplied Agent instance names as routing hints, not authorization. Before public production use, authenticate and rate-limit Agent routes and derive tenant or user instance names from verified server-side identity.
- Keep Agent chat behavior explicit with messageConcurrency = "queue", chatRecovery, and options?.abortSignal passed through to streamText. Configure waitForMcpConnections when the Agent uses MCP servers.
- For production Agent observability, use Agents diagnostics-channel events and attach a Cloudflare Tail Worker when structured Agent RPC, chat, recovery, state, schedule, workflow, or MCP events need collection.
- Update wrangler.jsonc when adding bindings, Durable Object exports, D1 migrations, D1, R2, KV, Queues, or Vectorize. Use declarative exports with SQLite storage for new Durable Object classes.
- Keep wrangler.jsonc production observability explicit: observability.enabled, observability.logs.enabled, and observability.traces.enabled should be true, with logs head_sampling_rate 0.6 and traces head_sampling_rate 0.05 unless production volume requires different sampling.
- Keep secret values out of project files. For an app-specific credential, declare its name with secrets.required and configure a per-Worker secret with wrangler secret put NAME or the Worker's dashboard settings. For a credential intentionally reused across Workers or AI Gateway, an exported project can bind an existing account secret with secrets_store_secrets; Worker access requires workers scope and reads it asynchronously with await env.BINDING.get(), while AI Gateway uses ai-gateway scope. Deploying the Worker binding requires Account Secrets Store Edit permission or an equivalent role. Ghostbuild managed deployment does not currently support Secrets Store bindings.
- Keep CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID and CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN as production deploy credentials only; do not use them as Worker runtime secrets.
- Keep backend code on Cloudflare Workers and Cloudflare developer platform primitives.
- Validate changes with pnpm run verify:stack, pnpm run typecheck, pnpm run build, and pnpm run lint.
- Deploy directly to the production Cloudflare Worker with pnpm run deploy. Do not add staging targets or local dev-server deployment paths.
