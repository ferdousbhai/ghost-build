/**
 * Plan how a project is written into an isolated build root.
 *
 * Builds used to be `tar`-ed out of the container's mounted `/home/project` while every guard
 * around them read the durable VFS — two sources of truth, checked and consumed on opposite sides
 * of each other. When they diverged after a container recycle, validation passed and three
 * deployments shipped stale code while reporting success (#139).
 *
 * Materializing the root from the VFS instead removes the second source rather than detecting
 * disagreement between them. The trade is round trips: one `tar` becomes a read-and-write per
 * file, so they run concurrently to keep the wall clock reasonable.
 */

/**
 * Files in flight at once.
 *
 * Each holds one file's bytes, so the ceiling is this times the per-file limit (16 MiB) — the
 * same order as the whole-project read this replaces, which held every file at once under a 64 MiB
 * cap. Raising it trades isolate memory for wall clock, and the isolate has 128 MiB.
