 * shows the command is running. So does being inside the silence horizon: a
 * quiet typecheck is the normal case, not a dead one, and the tool budget above
 * the lane is what bounds how long quiet is allowed to last. A command that has
 * gone quiet *and* outlived that budget has neither proof, so renewal stops and
 * the lane ages out on its own for another request to reclaim.
 *
 * An owner that actually died stops ticking altogether, which is what makes the
 * lease reclaimable in the case it exists for.
